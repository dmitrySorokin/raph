Make him understand the difference of mines and main dungeon
Make a PushBoulders() before Search()
Tile().canMoveDiagonally instead of "is door and tile.x!=blahlbah"
    Use this for tiles that I don't "fit" into
    Check which way the door is in case someone digs both walls connected to it and Eeek gets confused
Make him be aware of which monsters that are guaranteed to be hostile, and make him wait instead of approach the mob
Make a HealSelf(), perhaps cooperating with a Retreat()
Make .can() return the number of moves needed untill it's action can start performing so we can pick up stuff on the way to kicking a door

DIMA
1. diagonal moves (!)
2. fix bugs
3. make it eat
4. status and msg from nle, not from tty
5. You are carrying too much to get through.
